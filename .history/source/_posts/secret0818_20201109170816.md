hi，someone. this is not for anybody,but maybe this is for the future you

有人现在说喜欢小溪
是因为还没见过大海
而我已经见过了银河
却仍然只爱你这颗星

---《what can i hold you with? 》
\_\_ Jorges Luis Borges

i offer you lean streets,desperate sunsets, the moon of the jagged suburbs
i offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked long and long at the lonely moon
i offer you my ancestors, my family
i offer you whatever insight my books may hold
whatever manliness or humour my life
i offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal
i offer you explanations of yourself,theories about yourself,authentic and surprising news of yourself
i can give you my loneliness ,my darkness,the hunger of my heart
i am trying to bribe you with uncertainty,with danger,with defeat

《 爱你 就像爱生命 》 ————王小波
我把我整个灵魂都给你，连同它的怪癖，耍小脾气，忽明忽暗，一千八百种坏毛病。它真讨厌，只有一点好，爱你。

你是非常可爱的人，真应该遇见最好的人，我也真希望我就是。

“我遇见你，我记得你，这座城市天生就适合恋爱，你天生就适合我的灵魂。” ——杜拉斯

如果你给我的，和你给别人的是一样的，那我就不要了。 ———— 三毛

whereever they might be they always remember that the past was a lie, that memory has no return,
that every spring gone by could never be recovered,and that the wildest and most tenacious love was an ephemeral truth in the end
